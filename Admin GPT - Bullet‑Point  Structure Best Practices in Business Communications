Bullet‑Point  Structure Best Practices in Business Communications
Scope and Objectives
This report explains when to use bulleted or numbered lists versus short paragraphs in professional communications, how to position the ask relative to the value proposition, and provides guidelines, dos and don’ts, and sample layouts. Insights come from business writing guides, research on reader behavior and email marketing studies.
When to Use Bulleted Lists vs. Short Paragraphs
Bulleted and Numbered Lists
Bulleted and numbered lists increase visual appeal and skim value, draw attention to specific information and illustrate relationships among ideas[1]. The University of Oregon’s Business Writing Guide suggests the following best practices[2]:
1.	Lead with a complete sentence: Introduce the list with a sentence that logically and grammatically sets up the items[3].
2.	Parallel structure: Word each point in similar grammatical form (e.g., all noun phrases or all verb phrases)[4].
3.	Limit the number of items: Include at least two items, but generally no more than seven to respect readers’ attention spans[5].
4.	Keep items concise: Limit each bullet to two lines of text for readability[6].
5.	Use simple symbols: Prefer plain bullets or numbers over decorative icons to maintain a clean appearance[7].
Maura Thomas notes that bulleted lists are ideal for information that doesn’t require a response; they create white space and help readers digest information quickly[8]. However, if you expect answers to specific points, switch to numbered lists so recipients can easily reference each item[9].
When to choose a list:
•	You need to draw attention to multiple benefits or features.
•	The message contains more than three separate items[10].
•	Sentences are long or complex; breaking them into bullet points improves readability[10].
•	You want to create white space to reduce visual fatigue[11].
Short Paragraphs
Business communications often use short block paragraphs—each focusing on one main idea and limited to six lines of text in shorter pieces[12]. Paragraphs are preferable when:
•	Ideas flow better as continuous prose rather than discrete points.
•	There are fewer than three items to convey[10].
•	You need to explain context or provide narrative.
•	Using too many lists would overwhelm the reader[13].
Paragraphs should be separated by a blank line (not indented) to create white space[14]. Avoid unbroken blocks of text; they resemble a word‑search puzzle and strain the reader’s eyes[15].
Lists vs. Paragraphs at a Glance
Format	Best Use	Key Guidelines	Source
Bulleted list	Highlight non‑sequential ideas or benefits; improve skim value	Lead with a complete sentence; use parallel structure; include 2–7 items; keep each item short; use simple bullets[16]
Business Writing Guide
Numbered list	Request responses to multiple points or outline steps in a sequence[9]
Same as bulleted list, but numbering helps recipients refer to specific items[17]
Maura Thomas
Short paragraph	Provide context, narrative or a small number of points	Limit paragraphs to one idea and six lines[12]; separate with blank lines[14]

Positioning the Ask versus the Value Proposition
Structuring for Persuasion
The AIDA framework—Attention, Interest, Desire and Action—suggests that you first capture the reader’s attention, build interest, create desire by emphasizing benefits, and finally prompt action[18]. Applying this to email structure means presenting the value proposition (what the recipient gains) before making an ask.
Expandi’s outreach playbook advises a natural progression: hook → personalization → value proposition → case study → call to action[19]. By demonstrating value first, your request feels earned rather than abrupt. The Better Creative design blog provides empirical support: relocating a mid‑email call to action (CTA) to the top while emphasizing the value proposition increased click‑through rates by 15 %[20], and adding a distinct CTA near the top with clear verbiage boosted CTR by 340 %[21]. However, they also caution that top‑placed CTAs can feel too direct if context or rapport is lacking[22].
Best Practices
• Introduce benefits before the ask: Follow the AIDA sequence—start with an attention‑grabbing statement, describe the problem or opportunity, highlight benefits, and only then present the request or CTA[18].
• Ensure context: If you place a CTA near the top, briefly summarize the value proposition first to avoid appearing pushy[22].
• Use one primary CTA: Multiple CTAs can dilute your message. The Better Creative case study found that minimizing CTAs and highlighting only the most essential action increased CTR by 43 %[23].
• Personalize your ask: Connect the CTA to the recipient’s pain point or goal. Personalized messages yield higher engagement[24].
Sample Layouts
Layout A: Informational Email with Ask
1.	Opening/Hook – one sentence summarizing why you’re writing.
2.	Value Proposition Paragraph – 2–3 sentences explaining the benefit to the reader (e.g., time saved, revenue gained).
3.	Bulleted List of Key Benefits – highlight up to five advantages with concise bullets[16].
4.	CTA Sentence – clearly state the requested action (schedule a demo, reply with questions). Place this after the benefits.
5.	Optional P.S. – reinforce urgency or offer a secondary benefit.
Layout B: Request for Multiple Inputs
1.	Introduction Paragraph – set context and explain why you need input.
2.	Numbered List of Questions or Tasks – ask recipients to respond to each item; numbering allows easy reference[9].
3.	Closing Paragraph – thank the reader and indicate the deadline or next step.
Guidelines, Dos and Don’ts
Dos
Guideline	Rationale
Use a lead sentence before lists	Sets up the list grammatically and clarifies its purpose[3].

Keep lists short and parallel	Parallel phrasing helps readers see connections[4]; short bullets improve skim value[6].

Limit list items to seven or fewer	Honors attention spans[5] and prevents information overload.
Use numbered lists when you need responses	Enables recipients to reference specific items in replies[9].

Follow AIDA: benefits before ask	Builds desire and makes the request feel earned[18].

Test CTA placement	Mid‑email or concluding CTAs align with content flow but may be overlooked; top CTAs can boost clicks if context is clear[25].

Don’ts
Don’t	Reason
Don’t overuse bullet lists	Too many lists can make the document hard to read and dilute their impact[13].

Don’t use one‑item lists	A single bullet is visually awkward; rewrite it as a sentence.
Don’t bury the ask in the middle of dense text	Readers may miss it; separate the CTA and make it prominent.
Don’t request action before explaining benefits	Asking too early can feel pushy and reduce response rates.
Don’t use decorative bullets or inconsistent symbols	Fancy icons can distract and make the list look unprofessional[7].

Don’t cram multiple CTAs	Multiple requests dilute focus; prioritizing one action improves clarity[23].

Key Takeaways
1.	Lists improve readability but require discipline. Use bulleted or numbered lists when highlighting multiple points or requesting responses. Lead with a complete sentence, keep items parallel and concise, and limit each list to seven items[16].
2.	Short paragraphs support flow and narrative. Limit paragraphs to one idea and about six lines[12], and separate them with blank lines for white space[14].
3.	Value before ask. Following the AIDA model—attention, interest, desire, action—ensures that you communicate the benefits before asking for a response[18]. Top‑placed CTAs can boost clicks if paired with clear value[20]; otherwise, position the CTA after establishing context.
4.	Test and refine. Different audiences respond to different structures. Experiment with CTA placement, list length and formatting to find what resonates, and personalize wherever possible[24].
